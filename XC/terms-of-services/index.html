            <p>Claims of Infringement</p>
            <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and require that you do the same. In accordance with the Digital
                Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), the text of which may be found on the U.S. Copyright Office site at http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf,
                EDDY will respond expeditiously to notices of alleged copyright infringement that are duly reported to its
                Designated Copyright Agent identified in the notice below. We will disable and/or terminate the accounts
                of users who are repeat infringers. If you believe your content has been copied in a way that constitutes
                copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide
                our Copyright Agent the following information:</p>
            <p>Deliver this Notice, with all items completed, to us at:</p>
            <p>Compliance Department, c/o EducationDynamics, LLC, 5 Marine View Plaza, Suite 212, Hoboken NJ 07030</p>
            <p>While we considers all such notices seriously, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys'
                fees) if you materially misrepresent that content or activity is infringing. For example, one decision ordered
                a company that sent infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by
                copyright's fair use doctrine to pay such costs and attorneys' feels the company agreed to settle the matter
                at over $100,000. For more information, please seehttp://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/
                . Accordingly, if you are uncertain whether material infringes your copyrights (including whether use of
                copyrighted material may constitute fair use) you may wish to seek the advice of an attorney.</p>

                laws provision. Any claim or dispute between you and this Site that arises in whole or in part from this
                site will be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Hudson County, New Jersey.
                Use of this site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give full effect to all provisions of
                these Terms of Use, including without limitation this paragraph and the warranty disclaimers and liability
                exclusions above. We have endeavored to comply with all legal requirements known to it in creating and maintaining
                this site, but make no representation that Materials on this site are appropriate or available for use in
